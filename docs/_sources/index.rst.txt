oedtools Documentation
======================

``oedtools`` is a command-line validation and query toolkit for the `Simplitium OED <https://github.com/Simplitium/OED>`_ (re)insurance exposure data format.

The main features currently include

* validation of OED account (``acc``), location (``loc``), reinsurance info. (``reinsinfo``) and reinsurance scope (``reinsscope``) input CSV files
* searching for columns with required properties - headers (column names) containing certain substrings, column descriptions containing keywords, columns with certain data types, default values, required, nonnull etc.
* sampling any given column for randomly generated data consistent with the column range or data type range or a specific column validation function

Future features include

* searching for information about the OED data entities underlying the column data - location properties such as latitudes and longitudes, occupancy and construction codes, country codes, currency codes, peril codes, types and codes for deductibles and limits, etc.
